#+TITLE: 3D Seismic Wave Propagation
This repo contains the source code for a Finite Element simulation for calculating the propagation of seismic waves, and the accompanies Nix development environment via ~flake.nix~.

* How to Compile the simulation
Included in this directory is a makefile. This make file is about as simple as possible for a PETSc document and is reproduced in its entirety below:
#+BEGIN_SRC make
include ${PETSC_DIR}/lib/petsc/conf/variables
include ${PETSC_DIR}/lib/petsc/conf/rules
#+END_SRC
This uses the users installation of ~PETSC_DIR~ to include some standard variables and build targets for a PETSC application. Alternatively we could specify each included library in our makefile.

To compile all we need to do is:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make main
#+END_SRC
Which will compile the ~main.c~ file and link the appropriate PETSc libraries
